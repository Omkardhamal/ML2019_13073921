        "##Aim:\n",
        "The motive of this report is to develop a system that can detect failure of Air-conditioning systems before they breakdown. If we have a look at the current scenario in the world of air-conditioning asset maintenance, most of the maintenance that is undertaken is reactive. Reactive maintenance means repairing an asset after it breaks down. Maintaining assets reactively leads to increase in capital expenditure and loss of time and inconvenience. The number of breakdowns increases with reactive maintenance. Hence, to overcome this issue a method to maintain assets pro-actively (before they breakdown, so that the breakdown does not occur) is proposed. It is expected that analysing the health of these assets remotely and detecting any issues beforehand will give rise to efficiency and productivity of an organisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Background\n",
        "####Assumption\n",
        "The clients are industrial clients and not residential. \n",
        "As of today, 90% of the maintenance work carried out is reactive i.e. when an asset or an equipment breaks down the client calls up the entity responsible for looking after the asset. The entity arrives and repairs the equipment. The problem with Reactive maintenance is that the repair costs are five to ten times more than the cost of preventive or proactive maintenance. The clients have no idea about how the air-conditioning unit looks from inside, they ignore its health as they can’t see them because they are hidden inside the ducts or walls. This makes it difficult for them to understand what the problem is and they prefer reactive maintenance. But if they are shown how unhealthy the assets look from inside, they will be shocked and won’t realise how bad the condition was of the Air-Conditioning unit. For making the assets visible to the clients they need to be shown photographs of the equipment. It is not possible to convert all the reactive asset maintenance to pro-active but at least it can be reduced from 90% to 20%. Also, when an asset is about to breakdown, it operates abruptly, this means that it consumes more energy (KWh) than it actually requires. (Avonda, 2019)\n",
        "\n",
        "If maintenances are scheduled depending on their current condition, then there will be less consumer complaints and the clients can concentrate on more important aspects of their life. On successful implementation of this idea it is believed that the customers standard of living will increase as they won’t have to worry about unnecessary things which can be eliminated by using data analytics in Pro-active air conditioning asset maintenance. \n",
        "##Research Project\n",
        "In this section I will be discussing the important aspects of Pro-Active maintenance and how predicting its life based on the current condition will help the clients. Using this idea, asset management organisations will be able to increase their profits too, this part is also explained in this section.\n",
        "###Significance\n",
        "This proposal will help clients cut down unexpected costs when breakdown occurs. Continuous monitoring of the equipment’s will help analyse their health. Using the readings an appropriate decision of when a maintenance should be carried out will be taken. Carrying out maintenance before breakdown takes place will reduce the expenses on clients side. Also, as break downs won’t happen often the client will be happy with the management company and will renew its contract for maintenance with the same company. This will increase the revenue of the management company. Not only the revenue can be increased by continuous contract renewal but also the new system will be able to predict the life of the air conditioning unit, where the management company and the client can setup a contract in which the client can pay in instalments over a period of time for the capital expenditure of the equipment.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Innovation\n",
        "As seen before, it is observed that most asset management companies do not maintain the equipment’s on time and in a matter of time the equipment succumbs to breakdown. This method is not preferred as the maintenance companies are at the risk of loosing their contract. Loosing a contract can prove a huge loss to an organisation. If the asset maintenance companies incorporate this proposal in their organization, it is believed that they will be able to maintain the contract as well as they won’t have to spend excessive amounts on breakdowns. Pro-Active maintenance is an ultimate solution for the clients as well as the maintenance organizations as it increases the productivity for clients and revenue for the organizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s the clients choice whether to spend 100 dollars on reactive maintenance or 10 Dollars on proactive maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Action Plan (How the problem will be solved)\n",
        "Analysing and visualising the data makes it easier to understand the data. Once the data is understood predictions can be made and these predictions can help in taking important decisions in strategy making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially we will have to start gathering the data. This can be done by conducting the audit of the assets first. During audit, the auditor will check the condition of the equipment as whole and its integral components. These readings will be fed into the CRM system. The auditor needs to capture very minute details of the asset like,\n",
